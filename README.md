# This code simulates a hypothetical population and their health 
screenings for diabetes using three different guidelines: USPSTF, ADA, and AACE. 
The main goals are to analyze the number of people screened according to each guideline 
and the total costs associated with each guideline over the course of the simulation.

# Eexplanation of the code:
1. Define the transition probabilities between different health states (Healthy, Pre-diabetes, and Diabetes).

2. Define the costs associated with different health states for each guideline (USPSTF, ADA, and AACE).

3. Create a generate_hypothetical_population function that generates a list of dictionaries representing 
a hypothetical population with different health-related attributes.

4. Define an is_eligible_for_screening function to determine if an individual is eligible for 
screening based on their risk factors and the recommended guideline.

5. Create a select_screening_guideline function that chooses one of the guidelines for 
each individual in the population, considering their eligibility for screening.

6. Define a screen_individual function that simulates the screening process, 
updating the individual's health state, the last screened year, and the cost associated with the screening.

7. Create a run_simulation function that simulates the screening process for the entire population over a 
specified number of years, recording the number of people screened according to 
each guideline and the total costs associated with each guideline.

Generate a hypothetical population of 1000 individuals.

Run the simulation for 10 years.

Convert the results to a pandas DataFrame and display the screened counts for each guideline and the total costs for each guideline.
